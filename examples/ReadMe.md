There is a wealth of material online regarding using the SLURM scheduler/resource
manager for a variety of workflows. That material is not repeated here. The
basic role of SLURM on a cluster is to provide a mechanisms to share
the resources (espically compute devices (CPUs and GPUs), cores on CPUs and memory)
amongst a set of workflow. SLURM tries to provide effective mechanisms
to map requests for resources to do some computational work to
the resources that are available on the computer system. It tries to 
do this in a wat that ensures work get schedule according some rules
and that tries to ensure that resources are not left idle unecessairily. 
Some general resources introducing the SLURM scheduler can be found at
