The notes here contain a simple parallel R example from a politicial science
tutorial. The steps are general and could apply to many different fields 
where a large number of R based parallel task computations are needed. 

Note - for some functions R can be a slow processing language, (for example see, http://julialang.org/benchmarks/ ),
although it is reasonably fast for other 
things when coded appropriately (for example see, https://matloff.wordpress.com/2014/05/21/r-beats-python-r-beats-julia-anyone-else-wanna-challenge-r/ )
