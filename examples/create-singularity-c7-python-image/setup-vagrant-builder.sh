# We need a Linux system with root access to create a Singulairy image that has all the needed
# software preinstalled. If you don't already have root on a Linux system then the easiest
# approach is to create a virtual machine running Linux just for creating the Singularity image. 
# A quick way to do this is using "vagrant" and "virtual box". These are tools that are
# avialble in both Windows and MacOS environments. 
#
# This script assumes that VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org) and Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com)
# are already installed on your system.
